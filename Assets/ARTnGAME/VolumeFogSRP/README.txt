This is a quick overview of the Ethereal system.

The asset purpose is to create volumetric lighting effects in URP pipeline. Also has a few
extra functionalities, like creating impostor light volumes.

The main manual and quick setup note are included in the "Install Instructions" folder 
and contains the latest update manual for the system.

The Ethereal system is also a submodule of Sky Master ULTIMATE URP version, the only difference at 
the core is a few extra lines of code to connect the refelctions to the Sky Master ULTIMATE water
system. Also Ethereal store version has an extra forest demo and assets and a URP foliage shader.

If Ethereal store version needs to be installed on top of Sky Master UTLIMATE for the extra demo assets and URP foliage shader, 
make sure to install after Sky Master ULTIMATE URP version and do not include the ARTnGAME->VolumeFogSRP folder.
